Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}!

Get the application URL by running these commands:

1. Access via kube-proxy:
   Run the following command to forward your local port 8080 to the service:
     kubectl port-forward --namespace {{ .Release.Namespace }} svc/{{ include "swanlab.gateway.fullname" . }} 8080:80

   Then, you can access the service via:
     http://127.0.0.1:8080

2. Expose Service Externally:
   SwanLab self-hosted is not exposed to the public internet.
   If you wish to expose this service, you need to configure a LoadBalancer manually or use an Ingress Controller.
   
   Please refer to the official documentation for configuration details:
